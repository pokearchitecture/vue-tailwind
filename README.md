## Getting Started Developing

This project is setup with a VS Code dev container. Clone the repo and open it in VS Code. Enable the VS Code "Remote Containers" extension and then in the VS Code command palette choose the "Remote-Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container" action.

Once the container is build and the workspace has reopend, run the command `pnpm dev` in a terminal to start the development server. The app will now be running on `localhost:3000`.
